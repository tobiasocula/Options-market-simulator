To run the application, simply run

```
streamlit run streamlit_cross_excitation/Overview.py
```

in the terminal. To run the simulation itself with custom parameters, run the `run_once.py` function. The parameters for one run are stored in `params_for_cross_excitation.py`.

I wouldn't touch the self-excitation code, since it's outdated and not entirely correctly implemented.
